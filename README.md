# Audio-based-Payloard-Detection-for-UAVs

The evolution of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)technology has made these devices suitable for a wide new rangeof  applications,  but  it  has  also  raised  safety  concerns  as  dronescan  be  used  for  carrying  explosives  or  weapons  with  maliciousintentions. In this paper, Machine Learning algorithms are usedto  identify  UAVs  carrying  payloads  based  on  the  sound  signalsthey  emit.  We  evaluate  using  feature-based  classification.  Sevenindividual features, and four combinations of features are used totrain three machine learning classification approaches (a neuralnetwork,  a  support  vector  machine  and  a  convolutional  neuralnetwork). The training and testing dataset is composed of soundsamples  of  loaded  drones,  unloaded  drones,  and  backgroundnoise.  The  results  show  that  the  combination  of  features  out-performs the individual ones, with much higher accuracy scores.
